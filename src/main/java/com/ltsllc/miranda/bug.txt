Getting a start timeout when I run Miranda and there is another node in the
cluster that is online.  The start_timeout is set to 1000 milliseconds and
that seems like that should be ok.

Node.messageReceived is never called when connecting to 0.12.

Heartbeat messages are getting through on 0.12; there is a HeartBeatHandler
on the channel.  messageReceived is never called on 0.12.

startTimeout gets called repeatedly because the node tries to connect over and over again.  Next
step is to be notified whenever a message is received.

Get an ChannelOutputShutdownException when I try to add a ChannelMonitor

Tried setting SO_REUSEADDR, await still does not return.
