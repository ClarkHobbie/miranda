This is regarding the move away from auctions.

If a node times out waiting for another node to reply to a heart beat then it sends out
the following message to all the nodes it is connected to

    dead node start <uuid of dead node> <uuid of this node> <random number between -2^31 and 2^31>

It then waits for the following reply

    dead node <uuid of dead node> <uuid of this node> <its own random number between -2^31 and 2^31>

All nodes must be sent the message and all nodes must respond.  If a node doesn't think
that the dead node is dead, it should issue the following message:

    live <uuid of "dead" node>

If a node is too slow to respond, then a fast node issues the following message:

    timeout

And a new election is born

The process of electing a new leader is called an election where the random number is
referred to as a vote.

The nodes then select the highest vote and issue the following message

    leader <uuid of leader>

All are expected to choose the same leader.  If two or more nodes have chosen the same
bid, then another election takes place.  The process continues until all nodes have chosen a
unique bid.  At that point, all nodes issue the following message:

    leader <uuid of the leader>

if a node gets a dead node message, it is expected to choose a different vote from all
the node it has seen.

all nodes are expected to choose the same leader.  If they do not, then the nodes
elect again, except without the dead node start message.  And the process continues
until a leader is chosen.

The leader then issues the following message:

    assign <uuid of message> <uuid of node to which the message has been assigned>

Thereafter, all the nodes will say that the assigned node "owns" the message.  The
leader repeats this for all the messages owned by the dead node.
